# Squeaks Arcade (Starter)

This is a clean Next.js + Phaser starter with two placeholder games:
- Runner (`/runner`)
- Bubbles (`/bubbles`)

## Run locally (or in GitHub Codespaces)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open: http://localhost:3000

## Deploy on Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. Vercel → New Project → Import repo
3. Framework: Next.js → Deploy

## Notes

- The Phaser games are mounted client-side to avoid SSR issues.
- Next step: upgrade Runner to a true endless runner, and decide Bubble **Shooter** vs Bubble **Pop**.
